# Reproducible Script for Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference using a Coalescent Method in BEAST2
#
# Chosen Method: Bayesian Skyline Coalescent Model (BEAST2)
#
# Description:
# The Bayesian Skyline model is a coalescent-based tree prior that estimates past population size changes
# without assuming a specific parametric form. It allows for flexible demographic reconstruction and is ideal
# for datasets with one gene or marker (e.g., mitochondrial DNA). This method uses MCMC sampling to estimate
# posterior distributions of trees and population parameters over time.
#
# Assumptions:
# - The sequences are non-recombining and come from a single locus.
# - The alignment reflects neutral evolution.
# - The mutation model specified in the XML file accurately describes the substitution process.
# - The sample represents a single panmictic population through time.
#
# Limitations:
# - Results may be sensitive to prior settings and clock models.
# - Long runtimes can occur for complex models or large datasets.
# - Assumes no migration, selection, or recombination â€” violations can mislead inference.
#
# How to Use This Script:
#
# Prepare Your Environment:
#
# 1. Install BEAST2 and required tools:
#    https://www.beast2.org/downloads/
#
# 2. Also install BEAUti (comes with BEAST2) to generate XML config files.
#
# Prepare Your Input:
#
# 3. Use BEAUti to load your aligned FASTA or NEXUS file and choose:
#    - Substitution model: GTR+Gamma
#    - Clock model: Strict or relaxed
#    - Tree prior: Coalescent: Bayesian Skyline
#    - MCMC settings: 10 million steps, log every 1,000
#
# 4. Save as: `cervidae_skyline.xml`
#
# Make This Script Executable:
#
# 5. Run:
