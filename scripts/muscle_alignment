#
# Reproducible Script for Multiple Sequence Alignment using MUSCLE
#
# Chosen Method: MUSCLE progressive alignment
#
# Description:
# MUSCLE is a widely used tool for multiple sequence alignment based on iterative refinement
# and progressive alignment strategies. It is fast, reliable, and suitable for many molecular datasets.
#
# Assumptions:
# - Input sequences are homologous and suitable for alignment.
# - MUSCLE is installed and available in your system PATH.
#
# Limitations:
# - MUSCLE (v5) may require input redirection rather than standard flags.
# - It may be less accurate than structure-based methods for extremely divergent sequences.
#
# How to Use This Script:
#
# Prepare Your Environment:
#
# 1. Install MUSCLE if not already installed:
#      sudo apt-get install muscle
#
# Verify File Paths:
#
# 2. Confirm your input FASTA file is located at:
#      /mnt/c/Users/gavin/Downloads/Botany563/myProject/deer_raw.fasta
#
# Make the Script Executable:
#
# 3. Run:
#      chmod +x muscle_alignment.sh
#
# Run the Script:
#
# 4. Execute:
#      ./muscle_alignment.sh
#
# Version Control:
#
# 5. Add the script to GitHub:
#      git add muscle_alignment.sh
#      git commit -m "Added reproducible alignment script using MUSCLE"
#      git push
# Define the file paths
INPUT_FASTA="/mnt/c/Users/gavin/Downloads/Botany563/myProject/deer_raw.fasta"
OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT="muscle_deer_aligned.fasta"

# Check if input file exists
if [ ! -f "$INPUT_FASTA" ]; then
    echo "Error: Input FASTA file not found at $INPUT_FASTA"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Running MUSCLE alignment on file: $INPUT_FASTA"

# Run MUSCLE using redirected input/output
muscle < "$INPUT_FASTA" > "$OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT"

echo "MUSCLE alignment complete. Output saved to $OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT"
