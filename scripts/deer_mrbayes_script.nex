Begin MrBayes;

    [Method: Bayesian Inference using MrBayes]
    [MrBayes uses MCMC methods to estimate the posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees.]

    [Assumptions:]
    [ - Sites evolve independently under the same model.]
    [ - The chosen substitution model fits the data.]
    [ - Chains converge to a stationary distribution.]

    [Limitations:]
    [ - Sensitive to prior choices and model mis-specification.]
    [ - Long runtimes for large datasets or complex models.]
